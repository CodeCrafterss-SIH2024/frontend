          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
          The Planning Commission of India was established on March 15, 1950, by an executive order of the Government of India. It was a non-constitutional and non-statutory body 
          tasked with creating a centralized and systematic approach to economic planning in India.
          <br />
          <br />
           The commission was instrumental in shaping the countryâ€™s
           development trajectory post-independence, especially in terms of infrastructure, industrial growth, and modernization.
