      A preamble is an introductory statement or opening to a document, speech, or legal text that explains its purpose, principles, and philosophy.
<br/><br/>
&#x25CF; Preambles are often found in constitutions or laws. They explain the reasons and guiding principles behind the law, but they are not legally enforceable themselves.
<br/>
&#x25CF;The Preamble to the Constitution of India outlines the fundamental purposes and guiding principles of the document. It introduces the ideals of justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity.
